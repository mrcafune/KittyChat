## üóíÔ∏è Change Log

**6/27/2023**

- I've created an interactive setup process to make it easier for users to get started with our app. During the first time setup, you will be prompted to provide your Chat Model and API key.

- The `-model` command now allows you to change the language learning model.

- Added `-sessionsummary` so you can now print a summary of the previous session's conversation. It's a useful tool that provides a quick overview of the key points discussed, making it easier for you to review and understand past interactions.

- Added `-reset` command - encountered issues with your API key, language model, or just want to start fresh? No worries! The reset command now enables you to run the first time setup.

- Added `-clearscreen` command that clears the screen, providing a clean slate if things get too clutttered.

**6/23/2023**

- Improved the text generation rate to emulate GPT more accurately, resulting in faster and more appropriately formatted output

- Introduced functionality to color-code comments in the generated code for improved readability.

- Enhanced the Welcome Screen with additional, useful information for better user orientation.

- Revamped the formatting of the `-help` command to increase visual appeal and integrated the `-model` functionality.

- Optimized the feedback mechanism for Configuration Changes to detail the specific alterations made.

- Partially implemented support for additional models. There are still issues with consistent model switching that need to be resolved.

- The `-model` command is currently non-operational but is displayed in the `-help` command output. Work is in progress to make this fully functional.
