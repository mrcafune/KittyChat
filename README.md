To use KittyChat, you will need to have an API key from OpenAI and will need to replace the "api_token" variable in the Main function.`(api_key = ("sk-YOUR-API-KEY-HERE")`

After starting the application, you can choose to start a new conversation or load a previous session. The application will guide you with the available commands and options by entering -help. During the conversation, type your message after the "Message:" prompt and the virtual assistant will respond accordingly.

## Commands

- `-exit`: Exit the conversation. You'll be prompted to save the conversation.

- `-alwaysask`: Always ask at startup whether to start a new conversation or load a previous one.

- `-neverask`: Never ask at startup, always start a new conversation.

- `-help`: Display the help message. (lol)
